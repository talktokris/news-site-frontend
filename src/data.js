    content:
      "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has warned that artificial intelligence could be used by “bad actors” and make it harder to spot scams and misinformation. Wozniak, who was one of Apple’s co-founders with the late Steve Jobs and invented the company’s first computer, said AI content should be clearly labelled, and called for regulation for the sector. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur was among more than 1,800 people who signed a letter in March, alongside the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, to call for a six-month pause in the development of powerful AI systems, arguing that they posed profound risks to humanity. Some signatories to the letter were later revealed to be fake, and others backed out on their support.\nWozniak, known in the tech world as Woz, talked about the benefits of AI and the dangers. “AI is so intelligent it’s open to the bad players, the ones that want to trick you about who they are,” he told the BBC. AI refers to computer systems that are able to do tasks that would normally require human intelligence. One of these, GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, a company co-founded by Musk and now backed by Microsoft, can hold conversation like a human, compose songs and summarise lengthy documents. Wozniak does not believe AI will replace people because it lacks emotion, but warned that it will make bad actors more convincing, because programmes such as ChatGPT can create text that “sounds so intelligent”. He argued that responsibility for programmes generated by AI lies with those who publish it: “A human really has to take the responsibility for what is generated by AI.” He urged regulators to hold to account the big tech firms that “feel they can kind of get away with anything”, but was sceptical regulators would get it right. “The forces that drive for money usually win out, which is sort of sad,” he said. Wozniak said that “we can’t stop the technology”, but added that we can educate people to spot fraud and malicious attempts to steal personal information. The Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, sounded a note of caution when he told investors last week that it was important to be “deliberate and thoughtful” in how to approach AI. “We view AI as huge, and we’ll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis,” he said. Geoffrey Hinton, whose research on neural networking helped lay the foundations for the artificial intelligence revolution, has also expressed his fears that the pace of improvements could be a real risk to humans. He told the Guardian that there was a possibility that people could eventually be controlled or even wiped out by AI.",

      "Apple has launched a new emergency feature on all iPhone 14 models in Australia and New Zealand that enables users to message emergency services and alert family and friends if they’re in strife, even when there is no phone reception. The Emergency SOS feature works by connecting directly to satellites located more than a 1,000km from Earth. iPhone 14 users can connect to the satellite by calling 000 in Australia, or 111 in New Zealand, and selecting the Emergency SOS button, or by holding the side button in tandem with the volume button. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The feature sends details of your emergency, location, iPhone battery level and Medical ID, if enabled, to Apple-trained emergency specialists who can communicate further via text with the person about their situation and whereabouts.\nAnd while it has long been a myth that holding your phone in the air in different directions can help you find a bar of reception, that’s now a method that works with this feature. The user points their phone towards the sky and is guided by an interactive interface to find the satellite. The feature has already launched in the US, UK and parts of Europe. So far, it has saved the lives of 12 people. Last year, three students used the feature after they became trapped during a canyoning trip at a depth of 500 metres. With limited visibility of the sky, they managed to catch a satellite every 20 minutes to connect with emergency services. The response times vary, according to Apple, but can take as little as 15 seconds in clear conditions.\nAnother two people were rescued using the feature after their car veered off a road in California and plunged into a canyon.\nThe new Emergency SOS function can also alert parents, partners or friends. In an emergency situation, users can opt to send a transcript of their message exchange with the Apple-trained emergency to up to 10 emergency contacts.\nThey can also use the satellite via the Find My app feature to reassure family and friends of their whereabouts even when there isn’t an emergency – while trekking, for example. “Some of the most popular places to travel are off the beaten path and simply lack cellular coverage,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With Emergency SOS via satellite, the iPhone 14 lineup provides an indispensable tool that can get users the help they need while they are off the grid.” John Walters, the president of the Rural Fire Service in Cobargo, said the feature might not have made a big difference during the black summer bushfires given the scale of the crisis and the thick blanket of smoke which likely blotted out the ability to connect with a satellite. Also, “the elephant in the room is also that not everyone has an iPhone 14”, he said. But he said he can see situations where it could be a game-changer for people who are lost or injured in a remote area, or cases where a localised bushfire threatened someone’s home.\nAccording to Apple, the new feature was set up with experts to set standard questions and protocols for when someone calls emergency services. “I can imagine a lot of situations where it would be a very useful tool, such as a car breakdown on a lonely desert track, or in the high country where people get off the beaten track,” he said. A suite of existing Apple features has previously helped connect Australians with emergency services. Last year, an Adelaide man’s Apple watch called 000 on his behalf after the crash detection feature deduced he had been in a car accident. But, as the Guardian reported last year, iPhone’s have also mistakenly called emergency services from the pockets of people riding rollercoasters in the US, mistaking the bumps and jerks of the rides as car crashes.",

      "I’m not quiet about the fact that I love rhubarb. At this time of year, I want to use its forced, ruby-red stalks in just about everything: currently, I have a 2kg box ready to be cooked down into jam, the syrup reserved for cordial and jellies, some of the stalks chopped and ready to be folded into a cake batter or pie filling, plus a little held over to poach for my breakfast. Today’s pie is slightly different from an American one – the pastry is short and sweet, rather than salty and flaky, and, for ease, I bake it in a shallow, round casserole dish and serve it straight from that with some cold cream. Rhubarb and apple pie Prep 30 min Chill 1 hr Cook 50 min Serves 8 For the pastry 280g plain flour 140g cold unsalted butter ½ tsp salt 80g golden caster sugar 3 egg yolks, plus one whole egg for egg-washing Demerara sugar, for sprinkling For the filling 400g bramley apples, peeled and cut into 3cm cubes 190g caster sugar 200g rhubarb, cut into 3cm chunks 1 tsp vanilla extract ½ tsp salt ½ tsp almond extract 20g cornflour For the pastry, put everything apart from the eggs and demerara in a stand mixer and mix on a low speed until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolks and mix again until it comes together into a dough; be careful not to overwork it. Flatten the dough into a rough circle, then wrap it and chill for at least an hour. Meanwhile, put all the filling ingredients bar the cornflour in a bowl and mix, massaging the sugar into the fruit so the flavours meld and macerate. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Take the dough out of the fridge for 10 minutes to soften, and butter a 26cm round pie dish or tart ring (I used a shallow casserole, which worked very well). Roll out two-thirds of the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 4-5mm thick and lay it over the buttered dish, pressing it into the edges and leaving a little overhang. Remove any excess dough with a rolling pin or sharp knife. Stir the cornflour into the fruit mixture until it is well incorporated, then tip the lot into the pastry base. Roll out the remaining pastry to the same thickness as the base. Brush egg over the edges of the pastry in the dish and carefully place the lid on top. Seal all around the edges by pushing the two together gently. Pierce a small slit in the centre of the top of the pie, to let steam out while it bakes, then paint the lid all over with egg wash. Sprinkle on the demerara sugar, then bake for about 50 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven, leave it to rest for 20 minutes, then cut into portions and serve warm with cold cream or custard.",

      "If you feel like you never look away from your phone, Apple’s newest iPhones are for you, with an always-on display letting notification addicts stay connected all day, every day. Exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro, the display preserves power by dropping down to an ultra-low refresh rate of just 1Hz, dimming the screen, and handing updates over to a dedicated low-power coprocessor to keep the time, widgets and notifications up to date even with the phone in sleep mode. The new phones also feature the company’s replacement to the once-mocked “notch” that contains the front-facing cameras on all its handsets since the iPhone X. Now, a pill-shaped “Dynamic Island” will contain the cameras, while the proximity sensor that turns off inputs when held to your ear has been moved under the screen. The black blob will also be incorporated into a new notification style, allowing background apps such as ride-hailing services or voice recorders to keep some info onscreen.\nBut those updates won’t be coming to the company’s baseline iPhone 14. That phone, which gets a larger sibling in the rebirth of the iPhone Plus, is a much milder update to the previous year’s devices, looking largely the same, albeit with new colours, and even running on the A15 Bionic chip that was first introduced with the iPhone 13. The 14 Pro, by contrast, features Apple’s latest silicon, the A16 Bionic chip. All models of the iPhone 14 will have one major new hardware feature, however: emergency notifications via SOS. A specially constructed directional antenna allows users (initially only in the US and Canada) to send alerts to emergency services when they’re in difficulty, guiding them to point the phone in the exact direction of the satellite. To overcome the ultra-low bandwidth of the connection, which takes 15 seconds to upload a single message, the software pre-emptively asks the most important questions, avoiding a back and forth conversation. That safety feature is paired with a new crash detection feature, also available in the company’s new Apple Watch Series 8, which uses the accelerometers, microphones and other sensors in the phones and watches to detect dangerous car crashes and automatically call emergency services if not actively cancelled. The new Apple Watch also features a temperature sensor for the first time, enabling the company to offer ovulation detecting as part of its period tracking feature. The company emphasised that data from the sensors, which are carefully marketed as a fertility aid but not a contraceptive or a fever detection tool, is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that Apple itself cannot access the data, an apparent nod to fears that women’s health apps have become a new battleground after the revocation of abortion protections in the US.\nLaunching alongside the Series 8 is the Apple Watch Ultra, the company’s newest hardware line. A chunky, expensive and powerful watch aimed at hikers, marathon runners and scuba divers, the Ultra features larger buttons for gloved use, a battery life that the company says will peak at 60 hours after optimisations are released this autumn, and a titanium case that rises up to protect “the biggest brightest screen ever on an Apple Watch”. But British consumers wanting to pick up the latest technology from the world’s largest company have an uncomfortable surprise waiting for them. With the pound at its lowest exchange rate with the US dollar since 1985, UK prices for the new devices have risen well past parity between the two currencies – itself news when it happened for the first time with the iPhone X in 2017. The Apple Watch Ultra, starting at $799 in the US, will be £849 in the UK and AU$1,299 in Australia. The iPhone 14 Pro will start at $999 and £1,099 and AU$1,749, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max will start at $1,099 and £1,199 and AU$1,899. With the death of the iPhone mini, the new cheapest iPhone is the base iPhone 14, starting at £849 or AU$1,399, and the iPhone 14 Plus will start at £949 and AU$1,579. The company also announced the AirPods Pro 2, featuring a longer battery life, “adaptive transparency” for blocking out harsh noise like construction while still allowing ambient sound through the noise cancellation, and new technology for scanning a user’s ears to personalise the 3D audio. The headphones will cost £249 or $399 in Australia.",

And if the oven’s going to be on anyway, maximise that energy and pop in this mock eve’s pudding at the same time. Oven-to-table sausage traybake (pictured top) Use pork, vegetarian, gluten-free or vegan sausages for this tasty, no-faff dinner. You can use any seasonal vegetables, too – I even cut cauliflower or broccoli stalks into chunks and add them to the mix. You will need a large roasting dish or tin – mine measures 30cm x 25cm x 10cm deep. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 1-2 tbsp oil 4 garlic cloves 8 sausages 2 onions 2 celery sticks 2 carrots 12 small new potatoes 2 apples (wrinkled ones are perfect for this) 2 tbsp brown sugar 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp mixed dried herbs, or 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh herbs (eg parsley, sage, thyme) 1 tsp dried rosemary or 1 fresh sprig rosemary, chopped 2 heaped tsp cornflour 250ml apple juice 250ml water 1 tbsp apple cider or malt vinegar 1 cup frozen peas 1 good sprinkle fresh or frozen parsley, to garnish (optional) Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the oil, garlic cloves (unpeeled) and sausages in a large roasting dish or tin, then roast for 15-20 minutes, until the sausages start to turn golden on all sides. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables, and pop them into a large bowl as you do so. Quarter the onions and remove the outer skin; cut the celery into 2½cm lengths; peel the carrots and cut into 5mm slices; cut the potatoes in half (there’s no need to peel). Peel and quarter the apples, then core them and cut each quarter in half widthways. When all of the vegetables are in the bowl, add the sugar, soy sauce and herbs, and give everything a good mix (I find it easier to use my hands). Remove the roasting dish from the oven, squash the garlic cloves with the back of a fork to release the pulp inside, then lift out the skins. Stir the vegetables into the dish, then return it to the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the veg are tinged brown at the edges and just tender when spiked with a knife. Meanwhile, spoon the cornflour into the base of a measuring jug, then whisk in the apple juice and water a little at a time, so there are no lumps, then stir in the vinegar. Remove the tin from the oven, sprinkle over the frozen peas then pour over the apple juice mix and pop it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes, so the peas heat through and the sauce bubbles up and thickens. Remove from the oven, sprinkle over the parsley (if using) and serve on warm plates. Mock eve’s pudding\nA great family pudding that makes the very best use of leftovers. Traditionally made using apples and topped with a sponge made from ground almonds, my “penny-wise” version uses stale bread in the sponge and wrinkled apples from the fruit bowl. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4-6 125g butter, margarine or spread 125g sugar 2 eggs 1 tsp almond extract 100g finely blitzed breadcrumbs 3-4 large apples 1 tbsp flaked almonds (optional) Custard, to serve In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar, eggs, almond extract and breadcrumbs with a handheld electric whisk until well combined. Set aside. Peel, core and slice the apples into the base of a gratin dish (I used a 23cm x 15cm x 5cm one) – add a sprinkle of sugar, if necessary, though if the apples are past their best, they should be sweet enough already. Spoon the batter on top, then smooth it out with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds, if using, then bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 50 minutes. Serve hot with lashings of custard. Nancy Birtwhistle is the author of The Green Gardening Handbook: Grow, Eat and Enjoy, published by One Boat at £14.99.

      "In Meta’s quarterly earnings call in April, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was on the defensive. The metaverse, the vision of a globe-spanning virtual reality that he had literally bet his multibillion-dollar empire on creating, had been usurped as the new hot thing by the growing hype around artificial intelligence (AI). Critics had even noticed Meta itself changing its tune, highlighting the difference between a November statement from Zuckerberg, in which he described the project as a “high-priority growth area” and a March note that instead focused on how “advancing AI” was the company’s “single largest investment”. Not so, said the world’s richest millennial. “A narrative has developed that we’re somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision, so I just want to say upfront that that’s not accurate.\n“We’ve been focusing on AI and the metaverse for years now, and we will continue to focus on both … Building the metaverse is a long-term project, but the rationale for it remains the same and we remain committed to it.” But more than 18 months after Facebook changed its name to Meta – demonstrating Zuckerberg’s firm belief that “the metaverse will be the successor of the mobile internet” – the future he promised seems no closer to existence than it did back then. Reams of concept art, tech demos and prototype devices have given way to little meaningful progress. The company has even struggled to actually define what it is hoping to build: in a lengthy blogpost published last May, Nick Clegg, the former UK deputy prime minister who is now Meta’s president of global affairs, described the ambition only in vague terms, despite elaborating across 8,000 words how it would nonetheless change the world. “The metaverse is a logical evolution. It’s the next generation of the internet – a more immersive, 3D experience. Its defining quality will be a feeling of presence, like you are right there with another person or in another place,” he said. “Early versions of it already exist in the virtual worlds of games like Roblox, Minecraft and Fortnite. It incorporates technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) that, while still young, have been in use for some time.” But, Clegg insisted, the concept was not limited to niche gadgets that may or may not catch on: it already exists today. “The metaverse isn’t just about the detached worlds of VR, where we don headsets that take us out of our environment in the physical world and transport us somewhere new. VR is one end of a spectrum. It stretches from using avatars or accessing metaverse spaces on your phone, through AR glasses that project computer-generated images onto the world around us, to mixed reality experiences that blend both physical and virtual environments.”\nSuch an expansive definition – simply setting up a Memoji on your iPhone or logging into Fortnite could count as “using the metaverse” – helps Meta dodge criticism that the dream the company promised looks no closer to fruition now than it did 18 months ago. It also helps to make the prospect of actually building the damn thing look more appealing. In a piece of research commissioned by Meta this month, the Deloitte consultancy said that the metaverse could contribute “between £40bn and £75bn in additional GDP [gross domestic product]” to the UK alone by 2035. The 25-page report – one of nine commissioned for every large market Meta operates in, from “the metaverse and its potential for the United States” to “Enabling the metaverse in sub-Saharan Africa” – argues optimistically that “there is a large opportunity for the UK as a metaverse leader” and concludes that the benefits could reach as high as 2.4% of GDP. To reach those figures, Deloitte applied much the same vague definition as Clegg, but stretched the net even further, pulling in the entirety of the cryptocurrency space as a side benefit. “The metaverse will also likely necessitate the use of new verification technologies based on ledgers of permanent entries – blockchains, broadly referred to as ‘Web3’ – to support its decentralised nature,” the report argued. Some challengers for Meta’s claim to the metaverse are more like blockchains with rudimentary 3D engines attached: virtual worlds such as Decentraland and the Sandbox trade “land” and “objects” for real-world money but attract few active users otherwise. “Economic value will be created by new markets, business models, skills development and better ways of working in the UK,” said Deloitte. What new markets? Well, Liverpool football club launched an NFT (non-fungible token) collection in March 2022 “and generated revenue of £1.13m, even though 95% of the digital collection did not sell”. A few months later, Liverpool spent £85m on Benfica striker Darwin Núñez, so it is fair to guess that the NFT collection did not have a huge impact on the club’s bottom line for the year. “You see a lot of poorly reported or badly written articles referring to the metaverse as ‘3D worlds such as the Sandbox, Decentraland and Roblox’. The frustrating thing is, two of those are terrible website experiences that serve hundreds of people and one of them is a video game platform that serves 66 million active users per day,” said James Whatley, the chief strategy officer at creative agency Diva. He added: “Beware of the consultant that promises you metaverse numbers but then delivers a Web3 website experience. If you’re a serious player in this space, you want to speak to hundreds of millions of people – and those people play video games. Not crap 3D websites.” Education could also be booted, Deloitte insisted. “The metaverse could help transform classroom settings while allowing students to avoid the costs of moving to and living in the UK. This could be a boon for the approximately 600,000 international students currently attending UK universities.” So could healthcare, industry, live entertainment – and even just plain old office jobs. It is not just outsiders Meta needs to convince. Even its own shareholders are starting to revolt. The company lost $13.7bn on its “reality labs” unit, which handles research into virtual reality and augmented reality tech, in the last year alone. In a December 2022 blogpost from the unit’s head, Andrew Bosworth, he predicted that a full fifth of the company’s expenditure this year would land with the unit. But despite the years of investment, there is still only one real area where the underlying technology is actually paying off: video games.\nMeta’s Quest 2 headset, a £400 standalone device, is the market leader, capable of handling some of the most popular VR games on the market, including the Meta-owned rhythm game Beat Saber, and VR exercise title Supernatural. Connect it to a powerful gaming PC and it can play even more, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life Alyx, a sequel to 2004’s Half-Life 2. (For non-gamers, imagine if Doctor Who had returned from its 1996 to 2005 hiatus in the form of a Sarah Jane Smith-focused spin-off series that was exclusive to 3D TVs. And then won a best drama Bafta.) “Meta has done a huge amount of backpedalling about what it thinks is and is not the metaverse,” said Whatley. “I’ve seen Meta presentations that say augmented reality filters on Instagram count as the metaverse. But then I’ve also seen them say that we are all building the metaverse together. It’s quite telling that 100% of the top 38 bestselling experiences for the Quest 2 are all video games. The 39th is a ‘walk the plank’ experience.” And in that world, Meta is hardly unchallenged. Half-Life Alyx was made for a rival PC platform, the £919 Valve Index, which serves the needs of diehard VR gamers with its “room scale” approach, while Sony’s £529 PlayStation VR2 offers a similar high-fidelity approach for console gamers with a PlayStation 5 in the living room. And then there is the elephant in the room – and the reason why it may still be too early to fully write off Meta’s metaverse ambitions altogether. On 5 June, Apple is set to lift the lid on the worst kept secret in tech: its own virtual reality headset. Piecing together leaks from the supply chain, reports from California and the groundwork the company has laid with developers, it is clear that the iPhone maker is planning to take a radically different approach from its rival, with a price tag in the thousands of dollars and a long-term goal to create a device that people do not feel the need to take off when they want to speak to people in the same room as them. Like so much in the metaverse space, it is a vision that makes sense when you are planning for a decade’s time: with a refined version of these headsets that bundles the same technology in a pair of glasses, it could even be an appealing prospect to speak to the avatar of a work colleague floating in virtual space if the alternative is staring at yet another Zoom window. But getting from here to there is going to be a hard and thankless slog – and even Zuckerberg cannot burn $10bn a year for ever.",

      "The A-Team of big tech – Apple, Amazon and Alphabet – all delivered disappointing results on Thursday a day after Facebook owner Meta bucked the gloomy trend in technology, delivering better-than-expected results. Apple shares slid more than 4% on Thursday after the company posted a disappointing first-quarter earnings report, including rare misses on revenue, profit and sales. The iPhone maker missed analyst expectations on profit for the first time in seven years, after strict Covid-19 lockdowns and related protests in China upended iPhone production at its biggest supplier. The company also marked its largest quarterly revenue drop in nearly seven years, posting $117.2bn – down 5.49% from last year when it reported record holiday sales. The number was lower than analysts’ average estimate of $121.10bn. Apple alluded to ongoing headwinds in a press release accompanying the report, which observers are calling shocking. Strict lockdowns in China, which produces 90% of its devices sold globally, cost it approximately $4bn in lost sales in 2022. In a call with investors on Thursday, Cook said iPhone revenue would have grown in the quarter if not for these supply issues, but said production is back to pre-shutdown goals. For years, Apple has been seen as a safe haven for investment in the increasingly volatile tech space, but analysts say this report shows the tide may be changing. The company had warned in its October earnings call that it was anticipating a slowdown, with chief financial officer Luca Maestri citing “continued uncertainty around the world”. “Apple’s poor quarter proves that even the most valuable US-traded company isn’t immune to the challenges facing the tech industry at large,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, adding that the report was “shockingly weak”.\nAmazon reported worse than anticipated earnings on Thursday while at Google parent Alphabet, a pull-back by advertisers hit the search giant’s revenue. Amazon is facing a difficult reset after its pandemic boom and recently announced 18,000 job cuts. The tech and retailing giant reported a net loss of $2.7bn for 2022, compared to net income of $33.4bn a year before. The loss included a pre-tax loss of $12.7bn on its investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian. Net sales increased 9% to $514bn, compared to $469.8bn in 2021. The company’s most reliable division, Amazon Web Services, reported sales of $21.4bn, an increase of 20% from a year earlier but below analysts’ estimates. Alphabet narrowly missed analysts’ expectations, signaling lower demand for its search advertising during a slowing economy. Sales at the company reached $63.1bn for the quarter, marginally below $63.2bn projected. Last month, Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce, and vowed to create a leaner, more efficient company. It was then hit with a US Department of Justice lawsuit accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business. Both earnings results will be set against a turnaround at Meta, Facebook’s parent company. Shares in Meta’s stock surged as much as 26% on Thursday – its biggest one-day jump in nearly a decade. Meta’s share price surge came after CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to make the social media company leaner. Analysts welcomed the move, with many upgrading their recommendations on the stock. Apple has thus far avoided the mass layoffs seen by its peers in the tech space. In Thursday’s call with investors, Cook did not mention layoffs but said the company would be closely monitoring its labor expenses. “We’re cutting costs,” he said. “We’re cutting hiring, we’re being very prudent and deliberate on people that we hire.”",

      "Apple’s big, high-quality smart speaker is back for a surprise second generation. But five years since the first model was launched, a lot has changed in the world of voice-controlled home hi-fi. Can the HomePod still cut it? The speaker costs £299 ($299/A$479), £20 less than the 2018 launch price of its predecessor but more than three times the price of Apple’s other Siri speaker, the £99 HomePod mini. The new HomePod has the same design as the old version: a marshmallow-like shape with a light-up disc at the top, fabric-covered body and a small silicone foot. The detachable power cable slots in the back but otherwise there are no ports or recesses.\nAs with other HomePods, this speaker is for Apple users only. Those without an iPhone running iOS 16 or an iPad running iPadOS 16 cannot set it up, while Android and PC users cannot connect to it at all. It is designed for Apple Music, though it can play tracks bought from Apple or streamed from the iTunes Match cloud storage service, podcasts, TuneIn and some radio stations from Global in the UK. In the US and Australia it can play iHeartRadio and Audacy, too. Other services, including Spotify and BBC Sounds, can be manually sent to the speaker via AirPlay 2 over wifi using their respective apps on your iPhone or iPad, but not played natively through voice requests of Siri such as Apple Music. The HomePod does not support streaming to it via Bluetooth nor does it have any analogue line-in. Apple’s voice assistant works well for song requests from Apple Music and controlling playback. Its ability to hear you with “Hey Siri” at a normal speaking volume even when it is blasting music out at 100% volume is thoroughly impressive. Siri has more limited access to general information than competitors, but performs most tasks, such as timers, calculations and conversions easily. It has access to your personal information, such as calendar, when it recognises your particular voice and your iPhone is on the same wifi network as the speaker. Specifications Dimensions: 142 x 168mm Weight: 2.3kg Connectivity: wifi 4 (n), Bluetooth 5.0, Thread, UWB, 4x mics Controls: top capacitive touch buttons Speakers: 4in woofer, five-tweeter array Music, movies and spatial audio\nHow good the HomePod sounds is more dependent on your room shape and your listening position than any other speaker I have tested. When placed in a large open-plan area, such as on a kitchen island, it sounds great. It has plenty of well-controlled bass, detailed highs and good mids, with excellent separation of tones. It sounds great with normal and spatial audio tracks, though it can sound a little clean and clinical. Two HomePods can be paired up for even wider sound. Spatial audio tracks can sound fantastic if the recording has been well produced, though most songs sound better in stereo. But when used in a four-metre square living room, with the speaker on one side of the room next to the TV and the sofa directly facing it against the wall, everything changes. Sat on the sofa, all you hear is loud, booming and uncontrolled bass that totally dominates the sound. Stand up or sit on the floor in the middle of the room and the sound returns to normal. The problem is accentuated when used as a pair for stereo and spatial audio from Apple Music, tracks from Spotify and movie soundtracks played from an Apple TV. Moving the speakers left, right or further away from the wall makes no appreciable difference. I found the same problem in two other rooms of different dimensions but similar layouts. The bass reduction toggle in the Home app does turn it down to less overwhelming levels but also reduces some of the fullness of the rest of the audio in the process. The proper solution is to move the sofa further into the room, but that just isn’t practical. Sustainability\nThe HomePod contains multiple recycled materials including gold, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. It is generally repairable with an out-of-warranty service costing £239 and has an easier to access design than its predecessor. It draws less than 0.5W when idle, up to 9W at 50% volume and a maximum of 36W at 100% volume. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The second-generation Apple HomePod costs £299 ($299/A$479). For comparison, the HomePod mini costs £99, the Amazon Echo costs £110, the Google Nest Audio costs £90, the Sonos One costs £199 and the Era 100 costs £249. Verdict The second-generation HomePod is one of the most inconsistent speakers I’ve tested. In large open-plan spaces it sounds great. But sit in the wrong place, such as directly facing a sofa that is positioned against a wall in a medium-sized living room, and the HomePod can sound entirely dominated by baggy, booming bass, which is extremely disappointing for a £299 speaker. You cannot natively play music to it from Android or Windows, so only all-Apple households should even consider it and it needs an Apple Music subscription to get the best out of it. But if that is you, and you have the right room geometry, the HomePod is packed with neat features and works great with an Apple TV. Siri can hear you extremely well and perform most of the basic duties anyone is likely to actually want from a smart speaker. For most people, though, there are better options from rivals such as Sonos, Bose and Amazon at similar or cheaper prices. Pros: spatial and lossless audio, recycled material, improved Siri, AirPlay 2, can be made a stereo pair and used for Apple TV sound, good sound in big open spaces. Cons: sound quality highly dependent on room geometry, no native Spotify or BBC radio, needs Apple Music subscription to get best out of it, no Bluetooth streaming or line-in, expensive, not cross-platform.",

      "Apple posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings on Thursday, boosting hopes of a tentative tech recovery and sending company shares up. The company reported revenue of $94.84bn in its second-quarter earnings, up from a predicted $92.96bn, and an all-time record in its services division. It also reported a March quarter record for iPhone sales.\nThe report heartened investors, coming after Apple posted rare misses on revenue, profit and sales in its previous earnings released in February. At the time the company cited supply-chain issues for the slump, after its factories in China were affected by strict Covid-19 lockdowns and related protests in late 2022. CEO Tim Cook said in a call with investors accompanying Thursday’s report that those supply-chain snarls had vanished. “We had no material shortages at all during the quarter across any of the products,” he said, adding that the company was pleased it pulled out positive results “despite the challenging macroeconomic environment”. Regardless of the positive performance, Apple struggled in other aspects of its business – seeing its second straight quarter of negative year-over-year growth and net income down 3% versus the same quarter last year. Mac sales fell more than 30% to $7.17bn compared with analyst estimates of a 25% decline to $7.8bn, according to Refinitiv. The company has its eyes on other markets, after sales in China dropped 2.9% to $17.8bn, a slightly larger drop than overall revenue and growth in the Americas slowed. In a call with investors, Cook highlighted Apple’s growing reach in India as a bright point for the company. “I was just there and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable,” he said. “There are a lot of people coming into the middle class and I really feel that India is at a tipping point.” A 1.5% rise in Apple’s iPhone revenue contrasted with the broader consumer electronics industry, which is grappling with a decline in sales of smartphones, tablets and PCs as consumers and businesses who scooped up electronics during the pandemic tighten spending amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Apple has long been seen as a relatively stable bet in the chaotic investing world of tech, with fewer fluctuations than peers such as Alphabet and Meta. However, in its past two earnings reports, the company has warned of a continuing economic downturn. The solid quarter highlighted the “durability of the company’s brand”, and how consistent demand for its high-end iPhone products successfully offset other weaknesses in the business, said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n“The earnings beat suggests that Apple’s premium smartphone business may be insulated from concerns about deteriorating consumer confidence and a worsening macroeconomic outlook,” he said. Apple has remained relatively stable in its workforce even as companies like Alphabet and Meta, which grew their workforces rapidly during the tech boom seen during the pandemic, have laid off thousands of workers. But reports in early April showed this may be coming to an end, with corporate layoffs anticipated. Apple’s recent stumbles came amid a wider downturn in the tech world – one that is seeing a tentative recovery this quarter. Last week, Alphabet reported an unexpected rise in revenue during its first quarter and Meta similarly reported earnings that beat investor predictions. Apple may be uniquely situated to weather the ongoing headwinds, said Cohen. “Like other major tech companies, even Apple is suffering from the negative impact of a worsening macro backdrop and ongoing supply-chain woes, though it has done a better job of navigating through the challenging environment,” he said.

      "Plants in the umbelliferae family are easy to spot. They look like umbrellas, or parasols, with straight stems that, at a certain point, split into spokes that hold a lacy blossom cap. Identifying which member of the family you’ve spotted is another matter for most. It could be carrot, parsnip, celery, anise, coriander, cumin, fennel, parsley, dill, lovage, chervil, angelica or caraway, all of which have various wild and cultivated forms, some small, some gigantic. Last summer, a friend’s chervil was knee-high, while in Sicily we saw false fennel that could have been a parasol for a giant’s wedding. The lacy cap could also be poison hemlock, AKA poison parsley or devil’s bread, which is why picking feathery leaves or pulling roots of unidentified umbelliferae is not recommended. The tiny blossoms on that lacy cap bloom before they shrivel, leaving a tiny fruit, at which point the umbrellas are less Victorian ladies’ and more 70s rattan furniture: spokes topped with beads. In the case of caraway, the fruit dries from golden yellow to a warm, brown crescent with five ridges – so, while we say caraway seeds, they are actually tiny seeded fruits. They have a complex flavour: aniseed, yes, something of cumin and pepper, too, and also wood with a bit of resin, which makes them warm and sweet. And generously good, roaming far and wide in the kitchen, in rye bread and buns, and with pork, duck, lentils, cabbage, cheese, eggs and apples. Writing all this is a bit disingenuous; I’m making myself out to be a constant caraway user, when in reality the jar of caraway gets pushed to the back of the cupboard as boxes of relaxing tea are added to it. Or was. Thank you, Irina Georgescu, for your impressive and fascinating book of Romanian and eastern European baking, Tava, and especially for your apple and caraway cake, which has brought the caraway jar not just to the front of the cupboard, but out of it and on to the worktop next to the jar of dried red chillies. Apple and caraway is my new “coat-on” cake. That is, the one I start making as soon as I get through the front door, turning on the oven and fetching the butter even before I take off my coat, and then, once I have, it comes together quickly. Although that is disingenuous, too, because I work at home, so what I mean by coat-on cake is the one I make all the time, that comes together easily with ingredients I always have. The cake can be made while I brew a cup of tea, seems impervious to my mood swings and is constant. It smells like heaven, and tastes like it, too. There is good cake here for a family of two; any more, and there is a good chance you will argue over the ends, which, thanks to the butter, grated apple and long baking, are firm and crisp. The grated apple also gives the cake a soft texture, while the caraway seeds are flecks of warmth, also good for digestion, meaning this cake is a certified tonic. I highly recommend making it. Irina Georgescu’s apple and caraway loaf cake Prep 5 min Cook 50 min Serves 8 150g butter, at room temperature 150g caster sugar 2 large eggs 200g apples (to yield about 150g grated apple) 1 tbsp toasted caraway seeds 150g plain flour 2 tsp baking powder Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line a 10cm x 21cm loaf tin with baking paper. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar until pale and light. Beat in the eggs one by one, then grate the unpeeled apple directly into the bowl, discarding the core (s). Stir in the caraway seeds, flour and baking powder, and beat well. Scrape the mixture into the lined tin and bake on a tray in the middle of the oven for 50 minutes, until golden and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean. Keep an eye on it, though: if the cake seems to be browning too quickly, cover lightly with foil. Leave to cool completely before removing from its tin.",
